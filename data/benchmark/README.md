# K-VINTAGE benchmark artifacts

`core-authoring-matrix-v1.json` is the frozen structural allocation for the 40-record,
human-reviewed core. It contains 20 bilingual pairs and is validated by
`CoreAuthoringMatrix` 1.0.0.

Files under `drafts/` are review candidates, not approved gold records. In particular,
they must remain `annotation.status=draft` until a named human reviewer verifies them. Never merge
draft counts with the human-reviewed core or with machine-generated tier-2 probes.

The Korean/English `kv-core-data-02` pair was completed as
`drafts/core-draft-003.jsonl` on 2026-08-19 in feature commit `f2d2523`. Hyungbae Cho approved both
records on 2026-08-20 with review timestamp `2026-08-20T00:24:18Z`; approval feature commit
`473a733` moved them unchanged in substance to `core/core-batch-003.jsonl` and changed the
lifecycle tag to `batch-003`. Both records use the frozen `data` route, `train` split,
`eg-data-ecos-gdp-20260717` evidence group, and `ecos-200y108-snapshot-20260717` data-unit binding.
They reproduce the 2026 Q1 value of `596,692.8` billion won through `read_snapshot_as_of`. The
matrix, source bundle, rights decisions, public schemas, and execution runtime were not changed.

Files under `core/` are human-reviewed records. `core/core-batch-001.jsonl` contains the first four
owner-approved core records, and `core/core-batch-002.jsonl` contains the first two documentary
core records. `core/core-batch-003.jsonl` contains the two approved ECOS GDP records, and
`core/core-batch-004.jsonl` contains the two approved ECOS current-account records. Their
annotations preserve the AI author and name the human reviewer and review timestamp. Together they
total 10/40 approved records; the other 30 matrix slots remain unauthored and unapproved, and no
draft review candidate remains.

The Korean/English `kv-core-data-03` pair was completed as
`drafts/core-draft-004.jsonl` on 2026-08-20 in feature commit `50c4d9c`. Hyungbae Cho approved both
records on 2026-08-21 with review timestamp `2026-08-21T07:14:13Z`; approval feature commit
`db6700e` moved them unchanged in substance to `core/core-batch-004.jsonl` and changed the
lifecycle tag to `batch-004`. Both records use the frozen `data` route, `train` split,
`eg-data-ecos-current-account-20260717` evidence group, and `ecos-301y017-snapshot-20260717`
data-unit binding. They reproduce the May 2026 seasonally adjusted current-account value as raw and
normalized `38121.1` `million_usd` through `read_snapshot_as_of`. The matrix, source bundle, rights
decisions, public schemas, and execution runtime were not changed.

The approval renamed `tests/benchmark/test_ecos_current_account_draft.py` to
`tests/benchmark/test_ecos_current_account_core.py` with approved expectations and raised the
approved-count assertions in `test_bok_outlook_core.py` and `test_ecos_gdp_core.py` from 8 to 10.
The focused benchmark acceptance suite passes 33 tests across four files and confirms the approved
count is 10/40, and the full suite passes 1,141 at 100% SovereignLab statement/branch coverage
across 73 Ruff-formatted Python files. The 13 public schemas and five committed traces are
unchanged. The exact next outcome is an owner-directed draft-only authoring slice for the frozen
`kv-core-data-04` pair (KOSIS national CPI) using only the existing committed
`kosis-cpi-snapshot-20260717` evidence, whose use in KOR-RTD is owner-approved (ADR 0007); the new
drafts must remain `annotation.status=draft` pending a separate named human review.

The matrix assigns every planned documentary or data source unit to one dataset split. Do not
replace a reserved unit or move a pair between splits without a versioned matrix change, tests, and
an update to `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
